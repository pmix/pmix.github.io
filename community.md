The PMIx community consists of a consortium of industry, government, and
academia members spanning the general HPC arena, specifically focused on
orchestration of application launch and execution. The community arose out
of shared concerns for both issues associated with scaling of machines to
ever increasing size, and the ability to support the growing wave of
innovation in the HPC programming area.

[PMIx Standard](/standard)
===============
 - PMIx Standard (document)
 - PMIx RFCs
 - Publications/Presentation

The PMIx Standard is governed by an Administrative Steering Committee (ASC)
comprised of representatives from a consortium of research, academic, and
industrial organizations. The ASC shall consist of one representative from
each Member organization, as defined below, and shall perform the following
functions:

 - Define the mission of the PMIx Standard.
 - Plan release timelines for versions of the PMIx Standard.
 - Vote on all issues requiring community consensus (e.g., acceptance of
   proposed modifications to the Standard), one vote per Member
   organization. In addition to voting on proposed modifications, the ASC
   can be requested to vote on any issue submitted by a Member for
   consideration.
 - Assemble working groups to address specific areas of interest to the
   community.
 - Nominate and approve the appointment of individuals to fill the role of
   Release Manager for each release of the Standard

The ASC is led by two Co-Chairs responsible for organizing and conducting
the quarterly meetings. Co-Chairs may vote on behalf of their organization
subject to the one vote per Member organization limit. Co-Chairs are elected
from amongst the ASC members during the first meeting of each calendar year
and serve for a period of two years, with seats filled on alternate years –
i.e., one seat will be elected during the first meeting of each even year,
and the other seat will be elected during the first meeting of each odd
year. There is no restriction on the number of consecutive terms a given
individual may serve – however, it is expected and desirable that the
positions rotate amongst the Members.
