What is PMIx?
=============

PMIx is an application programming interface standard that provides
libraries and programming models with portable and well-defined access to commonly
needed services in distributed and parallel computing systems.
A typical example of such a service is the portable and scalable exchange of network
addresses to establish communication channels between the processes of a parallel
application or service.
As such, PMIx gives distributed system software providers a better understanding of how
programming models and libraries can interface with and use system-level services.
